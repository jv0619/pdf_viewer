# PDF Viewer

Welcome to the README document for the PDF Viewer project, developed by Akhil Kumar Reddy and Nithin Rodda.

## Project Overview

The PDF Viewer project is a Python mini project aimed at providing a user-friendly PDF viewer with added functionality. Our main objective was to create a tool that enhances the reading experience of storybooks, chapters, and articles by providing word meanings on demand.

## Team Members

The PDF Viewer project was developed collaboratively by the following team members:
1. Venkatesh Yarram (Team Lead)

## Features

We have implemented several additional features to augment the PDF viewer and make it more versatile. These features include:

1. Read the Page: This feature allows the user to have the current page read out loud. It can be especially useful for individuals with visual impairments or those who prefer an auditory learning experience.
